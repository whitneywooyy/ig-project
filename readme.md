If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?

This is a question I'm constantly asking myself, and it's become quite the hobby of mine to seek out new and well-traveled destinations alike via my favorite social network, Instagram. 

However, searching by hashtag on Instagram can be a hit-or-miss experience, as the search results may often times have you scrolling through a sea of selfies or online retail ads. Unfortunately, this is currently the only way you can search for media on Instagram.

This is why I wanted to create an app that was capable of searching through Instagram media that have actually been "checked in" to at any given location, since "checking in" is usually done by people who take their travels seriously and want to represent the places they visit as accurately as possible. 

If You Could Go was brought to life as my 3-day NO-server project while attending DevMountain web dev bootcamp in Provo, UT. The app is Angular.js-based and I'm calling both Instagram and Foursquare APIs in the services.
